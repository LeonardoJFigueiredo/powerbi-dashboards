## 📦 Dashboards Overview

<a name="business-sales"></a>
### 📈 Business Sales Dashboard

The **Business Sales** dashboard is a basic yet insightful sales analysis tool designed to showcase my Power BI skills beyond introductory training. While the dataset was originally provided during the _Power BI Impressionador Week by Hashtag Treinamentos_, I independently redesigned the dashboard structure, layout, and storytelling to enhance data interpretation and business insights. The dataset consists of individual sales records, including:

- Product sold
- Date
- Unit price and unit cost
- Quantity sold
- Product category
- Brand
- Country and continent

**📊 Dataset Size:** 203,883 rows 
#### 🧠 Insights and Features:
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Total revenue, profit, and units sold are displayed at the top for quick performance assessment.
- **Sales by Continent**: Visual breakdown of global performance showing strong revenue concentration in North America and Europe.
- **Top Categories by Region**: Comparative analysis of product category dominance per continent.
- **Annual and Monthly Trends**: Time-series graphs provide insights into seasonality and annual sales performance.
- **Brand Performance**: The horizontal bar chart highlights the best-selling brands, such as Contoso and Litware.

### 💰 Personal Finance Dashboard

The **Personal Finance** dashboard is a custom financial planning tool designed to track and analyze monthly income, expenses, and savings. It was inspired by the [Data With Decision YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@datalab365), but the layout, visuals, and business logic were independently expanded and customized to enhance storytelling and decision-making. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Month  
- Main Type (Income or Expense)  
- Category  
- Sub-category  
- Amount  
- Bill Due Date  
- Status  

**📊 Dataset Size:** 300 rows

#### 🧠 Insights and Features:
- **Key Performance Cards**: Total income, expenses, target income, and available balance for the selected period
- **Top Income Sources**: Pie chart showing income distribution across categories such as Salary, E-commerce, Google AdSense, and others
- **Income vs. Expense**: Line and column combo chart tracking cash flow trends over the year
- **Budget Tracking**: Gauge comparing actual income vs. target income
- **Category Breakdown**: Expense trends over time by category (Housing, Personal, Transportation)
- **Dynamic Month Filter**: Interactive slicer to filter all visuals by selected month
