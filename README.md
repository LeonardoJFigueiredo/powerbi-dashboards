## 📦 Dashboards Overview

<a name="business-sales"></a>
### 📈 Business Sales Dashboard

The **Business Sales** dashboard is a basic yet insightful sales analysis tool designed to showcase my Power BI skills beyond introductory training. While the dataset was originally provided during the _Power BI Impressionador Week by Hashtag Treinamentos_, I independently redesigned the dashboard structure, layout, and storytelling to enhance data interpretation and business insights. The dataset consists of individual sales records, including:

- Product sold
- Date
- Unit price and unit cost
- Quantity sold
- Product category
- Brand
- Country and continent
- 
**📊 Dataset Size:** 203,883 rows 
#### 🧠 Insights and Features:
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Total revenue, profit, and units sold are displayed at the top for quick performance assessment.
- **Sales by Continent**: Visual breakdown of global performance showing strong revenue concentration in North America and Europe.
- **Top Categories by Region**: Comparative analysis of product category dominance per continent.
- **Annual and Monthly Trends**: Time-series graphs provide insights into seasonality and annual sales performance.
- **Brand Performance**: The horizontal bar chart highlights the best-selling brands, such as Contoso and Litware.
